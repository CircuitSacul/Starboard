# Starboard

Starboard is an advanced, reliable, and highly-customizable starboard bot. This documentation gives you a quick start to using the bot. If you see a problem, please let me know. You can use the bots `suggest` command, or you can join the support server. My discord username is `@Circuit#5585`.

[Invite Starboard to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=700796664276844612&permissions=117824&scope=bot)

## Bot Features:
 - Supports multiple starboards
 - Supports multiple normal and custom emojis for *each* starboard
 - Completely free
 
 I'm planning on putting more info in the [wiki](https://github.com/CircuitSacul/Starboard/wiki)

## Quick Setup:
These directions are for self-hosting the bot. If you just want a working bot, you can invite it to your server instead.
 - Make a copy of `bot_config.py.example`, and rename it to `bot_config.py`. 
   - Update the settings to your liking. If you need help with this, you can join the support server.
 - Create a file called `.env`, and inside it put `TOKEN="your token"`
 - Run `python bot.py` to run the bot!
